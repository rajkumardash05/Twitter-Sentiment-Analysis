# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Stream Twitter.com on a particular topic to collect tweets in real-time and analyse their sentiments to assess the overall sentiment of Twitter users on that topic. 
Raj: I am creating this repository to combine my python programs that were used to collect tweets from Twitter.com in real-time using it's Streaming API and then save them in MongoDB database, which will be then preprocessed to extract the tweet text and feed into a sentiment analysis program to find out the overall sentiment of Twitter users on a topic at a particular time.
